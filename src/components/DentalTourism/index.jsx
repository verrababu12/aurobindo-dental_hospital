        <h2>DENTAL TOURISM</h2>
        <h3>WHAT IS DENTAL TOURISM?</h3>
        <p>
          Dental tourism (also called dental vacations or commonly known as
          dental holidays in Europe) is a subset of the sector known as medical
          tourism. It involves individuals seeking dental care outside their
          local healthcare systems and may be accompanied by a vacation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dental tourists travel chiefly to take advantage of lower prices.
          Reasons for lower prices are many: dentists outside the “developed
          world” are able to take advantage of much lower fixed costs, lower
          labor costs, less government intervention, lower education fees and
          expenses, and lower insurance costs. Much of the bureaucratic red-tape
          that engulfs businesses in the developed world is eliminated abroad,
          and dentists are free to focus on their trade, dentistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is that procedures, such as dental implants and porcelain
          veneers, which are simply financially out of reach for many people in
          the developed world, are made affordable overseas.

        <h3>Process Flow</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Travellers either contact tour operators or the surgeon directly.
            The queries are answered and the schedule is fixed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tour operators arrange all the documents and facilitate the trip.
          </li>
          <li>
            Traveller visits the tourist country and undergoes the treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Post treatment, tour operators organize the trip and provide all the
            facilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Traveller may need to visit the dentist again as per treatment
            required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Traveller leaves the country and remains in contact with the
            dentist.
          </li>
        </ul>
